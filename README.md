# Rover - Your Last Chance to Master DSA from Scratch

Because apparently watching 50 YouTube tutorials didn't work. Let's try this instead.

## What the Hell is This?

A brutally effective DSA learning platform that actually teaches you how to **think** instead of just copying code. Built for developers who are tired of "just memorize these 100 LeetCode patterns" and want to actually understand what's happening under the hood.

Think of it as your DSA sensei, except instead of making you carry water up a mountain, I explain why your nested loops are slower than a sloth on sleeping pills.

If you can't learn advanced loops from this masterpiece, loops aren't your problem. Your career choice is.

## Features That Don't Suck

- **Pattern Recognition:** The 5 patterns that actually matter (not 50, just 5 - I're not running a pattern zoo here)
- **Complexity Analysis:** Learn why your O(n³) solution makes interviewers cry and how to make it O(n) so they hire you instead
- **Real Code Examples:** 40+ copy-paste-ready blocks (I know you're going to copy them anyway, so I made them good)
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Watch algorithms execute step-by-step because apparently "just trust me bro" isn't a valid teaching method
- **Dark Theme:** Because light themes are for people who don't debug at 3 AM
- **Zero BS:** No "Subscribe to my course for the REAL secrets!" - Everything's here, for free, because knowledge shouldn't be gatekept

## Quick Start (For the Impatient)

```bash
# 1. Get the code
git clone https://github.com/purple-claw/Rover.git
cd Rover

# 2. Isolate your mess
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows

# 3. Install the magic
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Make it go
python app.py
```

Now open http://localhost:8000 and stop making excuses.

```

## Adding Content (For When You're Feeling Helpful)

1. **Create a new HTML file** in the right folder:
   ```bash
   touch templates/Your-Topic/YourAmazingContent.html
   ```

2. **Follow the template** (or don't, but then it'll look like a 1995 GeoCities page)

3. **Use the glassmorphism theme** - McLaren Orange (#FF8000), Meta Blue (#0081FB), and dark backgrounds. I have standards here.

4. **Add interactive demos** - Static content is for textbooks. I're better than textbooks.

5. **Restart the server** because it's not psychic (yet)

6. **Test it** like you actually care about quality (please, I're begging you)

## API Endpoints (For Your Curious Side)

- `GET /` - The front door (landing page with the slick McLaren vibes)
- `GET /dashboard` - The control center (where all the content lives)
- `GET /view/{path}` - Actual content (the useful part, finally)
- `GET /api/navigation` - JSON navigation tree (for the robots and SPAs)
- `GET /health` - Is this thing even running? (spoiler: yes)

## Contributing (Please Don't Break Things)

1. **Fork it** - Because you can't push to main (I're not savages)

2. **Make a branch:** `git checkout -b feature/your-brilliant-idea`

3. **Write code that works** - Revolutionary concept, I know

4. **Commit with meaning:** `git commit -m "Add: something that actually solves a problem"`

5. **Push it:** `git push origin feature/your-brilliant-idea`

6. **Pull Request** - Explain what you did and why it doesn't suck

7. **Wait for review** - I'll check if you followed the glassmorphism theme (yes, I care about aesthetics)

**Pro tips:**
- Test your code. No, seriously. Run it. See if it works. Revolutionary, right?
- Follow the existing style (McLaren Orange, dark backgrounds, sarcastic comments)
- Add interactive demos if applicable - I're not making boring PDFs here
- Don't remove the Feynman explanations. They're the soul of this project.

## Why This Exists

Because DSA interviews are the hazing ritual of our industry, and someone needs to make it less painful. Traditional resources either:
- Assume you have a PhD in mathematics (you don't)
- Give you fish instead of teaching you to fish (here's 500 solutions, good luck!)
- Are boring as hell (sleep-inducing monotone explanations)

I're different. I teach you to **think algorithmically** while keeping you entertained enough to not fall asleep. It's pedagogy meets personality.

## The Philosophy

> "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." - Einstein (probably)

> "If you can't explain it with sarcasm and animations, you're not trying hard enough." - Me (definitely)

I believe in:
- **Understanding over memorization** - Know WHY, not just WHAT
- **Visual learning** - Animations beat walls of text
- **Brutal honesty** - If your code sucks, I'll tell you (kindly, but firmly)
- **Free education** - Knowledge shouldn't cost $199.99/month

## License

MIT - Do whatever you want, just don't blame us when your code still has bugs.

Actually, scratch that. If you learned from this and your code STILL has bugs, that's on you. I gave you the tools. Use them.

**Built with:** FastAPI, caffeine, cubic-bezier animations, and the tears of developers who finally understood why their nested loops were O(n²).

**Maintained by:** A Depressed eveloper who care way too much about making education not suck.

**Special thanks to:** Euclid (for the 2300-year-old GCD algorithm), Dijkstra (for making us think about complexity), and every Stack Overflow contributor who's kept us sane.
